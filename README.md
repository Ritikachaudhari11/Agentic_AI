8. What is atomicity of updates?
A) A type of data redundancy
B) A type of data inconsistency
C) A difficulty in accessing data
D) A problem of concurrent updates
Answer: D) A problem of concurrent updates
Explanation: This is correct because atomicity of updates refers to the problem of concurrent updates, where multiple users can update the same data simultaneously, leading to inconsistencies.

9. What is data isolation?
A) A type of data redundancy
B) A type of data inconsistency
C) Multiple files and formats
D) Difficulty in accessing data
Answer: C) Multiple files and formats
Explanation: This is correct because data isolation refers to the problem of multiple files and formats, where data is stored in different formats and files, making it difficult to access and manage.
